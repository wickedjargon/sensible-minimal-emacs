# Sensible emacs config without 
This is an Emacs starter kit I've created that I'd recommend to anyone

## Details:

- sensible default settings.
- no custom keybindings set.
- clean look with no visual distractions.
- many high-quality packages for you to discover and use (see the `use-package setup` section).
- a comprehensive `.gitignore`
- settings that allow fast startup time.


## Installation:
To install, run

``` shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wickedjargon/evil-and-sensible.git ~/.config/emacs/
